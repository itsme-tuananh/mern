<p><strong>Hooks are an important concept</strong> in modern React - they allow you to add various functionalities to functional components. And that's important:&nbsp;<strong>Only to functional components.</strong></p><p><em>If you're building class-based components (which you also can), you can't use hooks - you got different APIs there.</em></p><p>In this course, we use functional components only and hence we use Hooks. Therefore, let's have a closer look at this very important <code>useEffect()</code> hook.</p><p>We already saw <code>useState()</code> before - this allowed us to register state which then is managed inside of a component. When state is changed, the component re-renders (or to be precise:&nbsp;It is re-evaluated and might lead to a re-rendering of the DOM).</p><p><code>useEffect()</code> does something different:&nbsp;It allows you to <strong>register some logic</strong> (i.e. a JS&nbsp;function)&nbsp;which will be executed when certain <strong>dependencies</strong> - which you define - change.</p><p>Let's have a look at the <code>Map</code> example:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">useEffect(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
  const&nbsp;map&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;window.google.maps.Map(mapRef.current,&nbsp;{
    center:&nbsp;center,
    zoom:&nbsp;zoom
  });
&nbsp;&nbsp;
  new&nbsp;window.google.maps.Marker({&nbsp;position:&nbsp;center,&nbsp;map:&nbsp;map&nbsp;});
},&nbsp;[center,&nbsp;zoom]);</pre><p>The <strong>logic</strong> here (i.e. the function) is to render a map + a marker on the map. </p><p>The <strong>dependencies</strong>, that define when this logic should re-run, are our <code>center</code> and <code>zoom</code> variables. Whenever at least one of these two dependencies changes, the function re-runs. </p><p>And that makes sense:&nbsp;If we got a new center or zoom level, we want to re-render the map!</p><p>However, React does not track these dependencies behind the scenes. Instead, <code>useEffect()</code>&nbsp;re-evaluates the dependency values <strong>whenever the component in which you use </strong><code><strong>useEffect()</strong></code><strong>&nbsp;is re-evaluated </strong>(i.e. whenever the component's props or state changed).</p><p>If the component is re-evaluated and the dependencies did NOT change, the logic in <code>useEffect()</code>&nbsp;won't run again.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>:&nbsp;The <code>useEffect()</code> logic re-runs <strong>AFTER</strong>&nbsp;the component (including its JSX&nbsp;code)&nbsp;was re-evaluated. That means, that the first execution of the <code>useEffect()</code> logic (when a component mounts for the first time)&nbsp;will <strong>ALWAYS</strong>&nbsp;happen <strong>AFTER</strong> the component rendered for the first time.</p><p>You can learn more about <code>useEffect()</code> in the official docs (or my "React - The Complete Guide"&nbsp;course of course):&nbsp;<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect</a></p>
