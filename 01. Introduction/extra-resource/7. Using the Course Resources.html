<p>In this course, you find many <strong>code snapshots attached to course lectures </strong>and always to the last lectures of each module.</p><p>These snapshots help you debug your code in order to find + fix errors or code differences.</p><p><strong>If something doesn't work as shown in the lectures, definitely look up the nearest snapshot you find attached and compare it to your code first.</strong></p><p>Code snapshots come as ZIP&nbsp;files which you have to <strong>extract</strong>. Then, you'll find the folder and file structure you also see in the videos.</p><p>If you want to run code snapshots, you need to run <code>npm install</code> in the project folder first. Thereafter, you should be able to start up the (development)&nbsp;server with <code>npm start</code>.</p><p><strong>Important:&nbsp;If we're using any database URLs and credentials, you of course need to swap mine for yours in the snapshots.</strong></p>
