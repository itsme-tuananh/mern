<p>The <code>fetch()</code>&nbsp;API&nbsp;is a browser API&nbsp;exposed in JavaScript:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API</a></p><p>You can use it to send Http requests to other servers - unlike the name might imply, you're NOT&nbsp;limited to fetching data. You can use <code>fetch()</code> to send <code>POST</code>&nbsp;requests (and other types of requests) as well - as you saw in the previous lecture.</p><p>In its simplest form, <code>fetch()</code>&nbsp;simply takes a URL and sends a <code>GET</code> request to that URL:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">fetch('some-page.com/my-resource');</pre><p><code>fetch()</code>&nbsp;always returns a promise which then in turn resolves to the response of the request.</p><p>An error is thrown if the request can't be sent. Important:&nbsp;NO&nbsp;error is thrown if the request is sent and the response contains a non-success error code (i.e. <code>4xx</code> or <code>5xx</code>). In such a case, you still end up in the <code>then()</code>&nbsp;block and you have to handle the error there (will be shown in the next lectures).</p>
